# LLM Benchmarking & Selection Documentation

> **Correction:** the comparison numbers in this document (e.g. "2,664
> generations", Mixtral at 9.2/10 quality and 95% success, and the "Code
> LLaMA" rows) do not match the real data checked into
> [`infranest/evaluation_data/`](../evaluation_data) - Code LLaMA was never
> actually run, and the real dataset has 121 generation records, not
> thousands. The corrected numbers, computed directly from that data, are
> in the main [README.md](../../README.md#-benchmarking-results)
> "Benchmarking Results" and "LLM Selection & Hyperparameters" sections.
> The qualitative ranking below (Mixtral first on quality, Mistral-7B
> cheapest) still roughly holds, but treat every specific figure in this
> file as unverified until it's cross-checked against
> `evaluation_data/generation_metrics.json` directly.

## Adaptive Hyperparameter Strategy

Based on benchmarking, we implemented context-aware hyperparameter adjustment:

### Use Case Profiles

#### 1. Code Generation (Production Code)
```python
{
    "temperature": 0.15,      # Low - prioritize correctness
    "max_tokens": 8000,       # High - complete generation
    "top_p": 0.8,             # Moderate - focused sampling
    "frequency_penalty": 0.5, # Reduce repetition
    "presence_penalty": 0.4   # Encourage variety
}
```
**Rationale**: Production code needs consistency and correctness over creativity.

#### 2. DSL Generation (Structured Output)
```python
{
    "temperature": 0.2,       # Low - structured format
    "max_tokens": 6000,       # Medium - DSL is concise
    "top_p": 0.85,            # Moderate - some flexibility
    "frequency_penalty": 0.3, # Some repetition OK
    "presence_penalty": 0.2   # Less variety needed
}
```
**Rationale**: DSL needs to follow strict YAML structure.

#### 3. Follow-Up Questions (Creative)
```python
{
    "temperature": 0.8,       # High - creative questions
    "max_tokens": 800,        # Low - questions are brief
    "top_p": 0.95,            # High - diverse questions
    "frequency_penalty": 0.6, # Avoid repeat questions
    "presence_penalty": 0.5   # Encourage new topics
}
```
**Rationale**: Questions should be diverse and thought-provoking.

#### 4. Analysis & Refinement
```python
{
    "temperature": 0.6,       # Medium - balance needed
    "max_tokens": 3000,       # Medium - detailed analysis
    "top_p": 0.9,             # Moderate-high sampling
    "frequency_penalty": 0.4, # Moderate repetition control
    "presence_penalty": 0.3   # Some variety
}
```
**Rationale**: Analysis needs both precision and insight.

#### 5. Documentation Generation
```python
{
    "temperature": 0.3,       # Low-medium - clear writing
    "max_tokens": 4000,       # Medium - comprehensive docs
    "top_p": 0.85,            # Moderate sampling
    "frequency_penalty": 0.4, # Reduce repetition
    "presence_penalty": 0.3   # Moderate variety
}
```
**Rationale**: Documentation needs clarity and completeness.

## Context-Aware Scaling

The system automatically adjusts hyperparameters based on project complexity:

### Project Size Detection
```python
if num_models > 10:
    # Large project
    temperature -= 0.05      # More conservative
    max_tokens += 2000       # More space needed
elif num_models < 3:
    # Small project
    temperature += 0.05      # Can be more creative
    max_tokens -= 1000       # Less space needed
```

### Framework-Specific Adjustments
```python
if framework == "django":
    max_tokens = 8000        # Django is verbose
elif framework == "go":
    max_tokens = 6000        # Go is concise
    temperature = 0.1        # Go needs precision
elif framework == "rails":
    max_tokens = 7000        # Rails is moderate
```
